A study on the extent of neutralization of sulphate aerosol through
laboratory and field experiments using an ATOFMS and a GPIC</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>In this study, experiments using artificially generated sulphuric
acid nucleated aerosol and metal sulphate aerosol across a range of
Extent of neutralization (EoN) found that the peak area ratio and hit
ratio of ion m/z -195
(HSO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) to ion m/z -97
(HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) detected by the ATOFMS increased with
decreasing EoN.</li>
<li>In ambient air measured by the ATOFMS and a Gas Particle Ion
Chromatograph (GPIC) in Toronto, Canada, ion m/z -195 was always
detected in ammonium sulphate aerosol, and its hit number and peak area
varied widely, regardless of EoN indicated by the equivalent ratio of
NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> +
NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). <strong>Thus, ion m/z -195 alone is not an
indicator of acidic sulphate aerosol.</strong></li>
<li>The average relative peak area of a negative ion (or positive ion)
was defined as the peak area of that ion over the total peak area of all
negative ions (or positive ions). ... Peak areas &gt;100 and &gt;20 were
used as the thresholds for the detection ions m/z -97 and m/z -195
respectively. Only a small portion of the particles with detectable
levels of ion m/z -97 also contained detectable levels of m/z -195
whereas almost all particles with detectable levels of ion m/z -195 also
contained detectable levels of m/z -97.</li>
<li>The m/z -26 is usually attributed to the CN<sup>-</sup> ion, and was
likely associated with vegetative debris or biomass burning. The m/z -26
could also be the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> ion from
primary combustion emissions.</li>
<li>No relationship was found when comparing the temporal trend of the
hits of particles with detectable m/z -195 to the EoN during the period.
Thus, we conclude that the ion m/z -195 alone provides no indication of
EoN. ... Ion m/z -195 peak area alone is not an indicator of EoN while
the hit ratio of ion m/z -195 to ion m/z -97 can be a qualitative
indictor of EoN in ambient aerosol.</li>

Using ATOFMS to Determine OC/EC Mass Fractions in Particles</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Historically, obtaining quantitative chemical information using
laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry for analyzing individual
aerosol particles has been quite challenging. This is due in large part
to fluctuations in the absolute ion signals resulting from
inhomogeneities in the laser beam profile, as well as chemical matrix
effects.</li>
<li>However, as shown herein, averaging the mass spectra of an ensemble
of particles of the same size with similar chemical composition reduces
the effects of the shot-to-shot single particle ion signal
fluctuations.</li>
<li>The UF-ATOFMS was operated down stream of a <strong>multiple orifice
uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI)</strong> which removed over 50% of
particles greater than 450 nm (aerodynamic diameter). For UF-ATOFMS data
analysis, only particles between 50 and 400 nm were analyzed.</li>
<li>Note that the major peak observed for the uncoated particles at 106
nm is shifted down to 76 nm upon coating, suggesting the 100 nm EC
particles have collapsed. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and
SMPS, <strong>spark discharge EC and diesel generated EC has been
observed to collapse (rearrange) into a more spherical particle when
coated with OC</strong>.</li>
<li>The plots show <u>a broad distribution of</u> particle sizes. This
wide distribution corresponds to EC particles coated with varying
amounts of OC, as well as EC particles with a distribution of
shapes.</li>
<li>The uncoated EC area matrix is dominated by positive ion carbon
cluster peaks <sup>12</sup>C<sub>1</sub> to <sup>96</sup>C<sub>8</sub>
attributed to EC. A peak at m/z +28 is also observed which is attributed
to silicon. ... The OC coated spark discharge EC in Figure 5 shows many
peaks attributed to EC, however, it also contains OC peaks at m/z 27
(CNH<sup>+</sup>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>), 29
(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub><sup>+</sup>), 37
(C<sub>3</sub>H<sup>+</sup>), 39
(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>), 43
(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> ,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>), 51
(C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>), and 63
(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>).</li>

<li>To establish a correlation between OC/EC intensity ratios and the
mass of OC and EC in particles, the ion markers shown in Figure 5
attributed to OC (m/z 27+, 29+, 37+, 43+) and EC (m/z 36+, 48+, 60+) are
used as they are commonly observed in ambient particles. Other ions for
OC such as m/z 39+, 41+, and 51+ were not chosen because ions from
potassium and vanadium are also observed at these m/z in ambient
particles. ... However, the signals tend to increase and decrease in the
same proportion, and thus by using <strong>the ratio of OC to EC ion
intensities to calculate the OC/EC mass fractions</strong>, the effect
of the ion signal fluctuations on quantification is minimized.</li>
<li>A linear correlation exists between the OC/EC ion ratio and mass
percentage of OC calculated from assumed material densities with an
R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.98. ... A linear correlation with an
R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.99 is shown in Figure 6 for the percent of OC
mass calculated from effective densities and the OC/EC ratios. ... These
correlations show it is possible to calibrate the ATOFMS using ion
intensity ratios and obtain quantitative chemical information for
particles with similar chemical matrices. ... It is important to note
that a break at 1 μm separates particles composed of predominately
organic versus inorganic matrices. Thus this calibration curve will most
likely be most effective for sub-μm particles since these will have
similar carbonaceous matrices and thus similar ion signal
responses.</li>
<li>As shown, the OC/EC ratios for the ambient and vehicle data sets lie
within the range of OC/EC ion intensity ratios observed for the
laboratory generated OC-EC particles presented here. This suggests the
OC/EC ratios calculated using laboratory generated OC-EC particle
standards indeed have atmospheric relevance and can be used to estimate
the fractions of OC and EC in ambient particles with similar chemical
composition and size.</li>

Mass spectra features of biomass burning boiler and coal burning boiler
emitted particles by single particle aerosol mass spectrometer</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Particle samples were collected from a sugar factory which uses a
biomass burning boiler (BBB) and from a power plant which uses a coal
burning boiler (CBB) in Guangxi Province, China. ... The biomass burning
boiler in this study burns bagasse from sugar cane to generate
electricity. To consider the feasibility, samples were collected from
bottom of electrostatic precipitators with a plastic brush.</li>
<li>The experimental system consisted of a Resuspension Chamber, a
single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS), and an Electrical Low
Pressure Impactor (ELPI).</li>
<li>Because the particle-detection efficiency of the SPAMS exhibits a
strong dependence on particle size, thus the size distribution obtained
by SPAMS is not the actual atmospheric concentrations. However, the size
distributions remain useful for comparing particle types. ... By
comparing the size distributions measured by SPAMS and ELPI, we
determined that particles always peaked between 0.4 and 0.5 μm measured
by SPAMS caused by higher particle passing efficiencies in this size
range. Larger-sized particles were seldom detected because of lower
passing efficiencies. Therefore, the SPAMS cannot provide quantitative
measurements without appropriate scaling factors.</li>
<li>Size distribution results measured by ELPI indicated that two
samples produce different size distributions; the BBB sample
concentrated in small particle size range and peaked between 0.23 and
0.38 μm, while the CBB particles concentrated in a larger size range and
peaked between 0.65 and 1.11 μm.</li>

<li>Sodium (m/z 23), aluminum (m/z 27), potassium (m/z 39), calcium (m/z
40, 56), organic fragments (m/z 37, 43, 50, 51, 61, 63), elemental
carbon cluster ions, sulfate (m/z −80, −97), nitrate (m/z −46, −62),
CN<sup>−</sup> (m/z −26, 42), phosphate (m/z −63, −79), silicate (m/z
−60, −76) all presented in the spectra of BBB and CBB. However, the
peaks of 27[Al]<sup>+</sup>, 40[Ca]<sup>+</sup>, and silicate are higher
in CBB than those of BBB, while the peaks of carbon cluster ions and
organic fragments are lower than those of BBB. This result indicates
that inorganic compounds such as silicate, calcium, aluminum contribute
a significant fraction of particles emitted from coal combustion.</li>
<li>For both of BBB and CBB, intensities of 27[Al]<sup>+</sup>,
40[Ca]<sup>+</sup>, 56[Fe/CaO]<sup>+</sup>, and Si (m/z -60, -76),
increase as the size increases, while the signals characteristic of
elemental carbon 36[C<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and organic carbon
37[C<sub>3</sub>H]<sup>+</sup> decrease. In addition, by comparing with
other studies on chemical components of particles emitted by coal
combustion source, Si, Al, Fe and Ca seemed to be the dominant
components, but smaller particles tended to have less Si, which agrees
with the size variation of m/z –76 signal intensity.</li>
<li>For BBB particles in the 0.2–0.5 μm range,most of the particles were
OC and EC-containing particles which contribute 35% and 23%,
respectively, in addition to the 5% contributed by OCEC mixed particles.
In the 0.2–0.5 μm size range, EC-containing particles also contribute
the largest fraction (24%), followed by ECOC-containing particles (20%).
In the 0.5–1.0 μm size range, silicate containing particle classes, such
as silicate, Al_Ca_Ti_Silicate, Al_Ti_Silicate, Al_Silicate classes had
much higher contributions than in 0.2–0.5 μm.</li>
<li>To quantify the similarity of characteristic classes of two samples
in the same size range, dot products were also calculated between two
samples as shown in Fig. 6. As expected, those classes exhibiting the
best matches are chemically similar types: i.e., in size range 0.2–0.5
μm, OC class from coal burning boiler is similar to OC_Nitrate class
from biomass burning boiler; in size range 0.5–1.0 μm, Al_Ti_Silicate
class from coal burning boiler is similar to Al_Silicate class from
biomass burning boiler. This result indicated that two sources might
discharge particles with similar mass spectra.</li>

Refined source apportionment of coal combustion sources by using single
particle mass spectrometry</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>In this study, samples of three typical coal combustion source
types, including Domestic bulk coal combustion (DBCC), Heat supply
station (HSS), and Power plant (PP) were sampled. For sampling coal
combustion particles samples from PP and HSS, vehicle loaded SPAMS were
placed under the chimney in the factories. During the sampling, a
stainless steel tube was inserted in the sampling hole on the chimney
enough, to make sure the tube could reach inside of the chimney. Airflow
together with particle samples were pumped out through a closed silicone
tube from chimney breast, and were then imported into the SPAMS. For
sampling the real Domestic Bulk Coal Combustion particles in rural
areas, particle samples were collected by a sampling bags, which were
made by Teflon.</li>
<li>It's important to note that size distribution measured by SPAMS can
only provide semi-quantitative meanings, and size distribution result in
this study might be different from the real world. In this study, size
distribution of PP was wider than the other two, and that of DBCC was
narrow. Besides, as shown in the figure, most of the particles
concentrated in the sizes less than 1.0 μm.</li>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Mass spectra features of PP emitted particles: In this study,
signals of these metal components, including silicate (m/z
-60[SiO2]<sup>−</sup>, −76[SiO3]<sup>−</sup>), aluminum (m/z
27[Al]<sup>+</sup>, −43[AlO]<sup>−</sup>), calcium(m/z
40[Ca]<sup>+</sup>, 56[CaO]<sup>+</sup>) and iron (m/z
56[Fe]<sup>+</sup>), show significant intensities. Power plant coal
burning mass spectral features obtained in this study is in consistent
with Zhang's work (Zhang et al., 2005). They found the primary chemical
components of the particulate matter emitted from the coal-fired power
plants were SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CaO. Besides, in Wang's study, who used
ATOFMS to sample the aerosol produced during pulverized coal combustion
in a drop tube furnace (Wang et al., 2013), also found that
27[Al]<sup>+</sup>, 39[K]<sup>+</sup>, 40[Ca]+<sup>+</sup>,
56[Fe/CaO]<sup>+</sup>, elemental carbon clusters (including −24, −36,
−48, −60 etc) and organic carbon fragments (including −45, −59, −73)
appear in the average mass spectrum, which are consistent with the peaks
found in our study.</li>
<li>OC fragments were extracted as tracer signals for HSS and DBCC, and
their intensities seem to be much higher than those in PP. This might be
reasonable because pulverized coal combustion in PP has sufficient
mixing of coal and air, and result in high efficiency. And DBCC has
insufficient mixing of coal and air, which will result in much higher
emissions of organic carbon. Signals corresponding to crustal chemical
components like Si, Al and Ca, were extracted as tracer signals in PP
source sample.</li>
<li>First, coal is a complex mixture of many elements, different coal
types have very different compositions. Second, combustion conditions
play a very important role in particle formation, for example,
temperature and gas condition. Third, air pollution control devices can
greatly affect emission of particulate matter.</li>

Characterization of organic aerosol produced during pulverized coal
combustion in a drop tube furnace</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Controlled bench scale pulverized coal combustion studies were
performed. High-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer
(HR-Tof-AMS) was applied to characterize fine particle formation during
coal combustion. The average AMS organic mass spectra of aerosol from
the drop tube coal combustor under various oxygen/coal ratios show that
Many significant organic peaks are observed. Typical OC ions in AMS
including C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 43.054779),
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (m/z 43.018391),
CO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 43.989830), m/z 55,
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 57.070431),
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (m/z 57.034039),
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 60),
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 73),
C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 91.054771). The ratio of
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>
and
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub><sup>+</sup>/C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sup>+</sup>
can be considered as an indicator of the extent of oxygenation. The peak
at m/z 91 should originate from aromatic compounds, and the ion
C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 91.054771) contains a
benzene ring.</li>
<li>In the spectra of HR-Tof-AMS, peaks at m/z 60 and 73 are generally
considered as important biomass burning particle tracers. The ion
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> (m/z 60) is
traditionally considered to result from fragmentation of levoglucosan.
To further characterize the organics, fine particulate matter from the
coal combustor was collected, extracted and analysed by Aerosol
Time-of-fight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS) and gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC/MS). Peaks at m/z of −45, −59 and −73 in ATOFMS spectra
are usually considered as the fragments of levoglucosan. However, no
levoglucosan was detected by GC/MS, which implies that other detected
compounds (e.g. some carboxylic acids) most likely contributed to the
observed m/z 60 and 73 in AMS, and m/z −45, −59 and −73 in ATOFMS. This
observation implies that the peaks in AMS (m/z 60 and 73) and ATOFMS
(m/z −45, −59 and −73) are not unique biomass burning tracers for
particles in the atmosphere. Due to the mass spectral signatures overlap
with some well-known biomass burning tracers, particles emitted from
coal combustors have the potential to be incorrectly assigned as biomass
burning aerosol by tracer based source apportionment. The similarity of
the organic species in aerosol formed during coal combustion and biomass
burning is due to the fact that coal has its origins from biomass and
was formed via coalification, which is a process that reduces hydrogen
and oxygen content of biomass (with cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose
being the major components) and increases the fraction of carbon content
(Haenel, 1992).</li>
<li>Particles from coal combustion are a mixture of inorganic and
organic compounds. The ATOFMS mass spectrum contains many inorganic
peaks, such as Ca, Na and K. Organic matter is typically fully oxidized
(to gaseous CO<sub>2</sub> and CO) in air at high combustion
temperatures. Thus, the organic matter detected in the particles was
probably prevented from oxidation by unknown mechanisms in the
combustor. A conjecture is proposed: the organic vapors are adsorbed by
inorganic particles during coal combustion. After adsorption of organic
vapors, inorganic particles may continue to grow, thereby covering and
protecting organic matter from further oxidation. ... Figure 5
summarizes the proposed formation mechanisms of OA during pulverized
coal combustion: Molecules in coal usually contain aromatic clusters
which are connected by hydrocarbon bridges and loops. The bond strength
of aromatic rings is much greater than those of the hydrocarbon bridges
and loops. When coal particles are combusted in the furnace, bridges and
loops break apart first. Tar, a group of compounds with smaller
molecular weights, are released. In the furnace, most of gas-phase tar
is quickly oxidized and fully combusted. However, some of the tar
species are adsorbed by the inorganic ash particles with chemical
composition such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CaO
and sulfate. These particles can protect tar from further oxidation.
Therefore, particulate organic matter survives the highly oxidizing
environment and may potentially be emitted to the atmosphere.</li>

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Ambient aerosol was measured in Shanghai using ATOFMS. A unique type
of particle observed in the atmosphere was identified from coal
combustion. It has dominant potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) peaks in the
positive spectrum and secondary inorganic peaks
(NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> ,NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>,
HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>, etc.) in the negative spectrum. Li, Al, Ca,
CaO/Fe and other metal/metal oxide peaks were also present. Weaker peaks
of Al<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>+</sup>, CaO/Fe<sup>+</sup> may be due to the
aging process of aerosols in the atmosphere: Oxides of Al, Ca, and Fe
can quickly react with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in the atmosphere to
form sulfates which have a much lower ionization efficiency in the
ATOFMS. Therefore, the Al<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>+</sup>, and CaO/Fe^+
peaks will be much weaker than those in freshly emitted particles. ...
Other field studies have also reported certain types of ambient aerosols
originating from coal combustion. For instance, a series of studies on
ambient aerosol in Pittsburgh suggested that the particles with the
signal of Na/Si/K/Ca/Fe/Ga/Pb were associated with coal combustion
emissions. However, Healy et al. (2010) showed that Ga and Fe were not
present in their coal combustion aerosols. In this study, Na/K/Ca/Fe and
Pb were observed in the type of ambient aerosols, which is considered to
originate from coal combustion, but no significant peak of Si and Ga was
present. In addition, Liu et al. (2003) reported that coal combustion
aerosols contain the signal of Li, while both Healy et al. (2010) and
this study did not find this signal.</li>
